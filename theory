The scanf() function reads the sequence of characters until it encounters a whitespace (space, newline, tab etc.).\n
You can use gets() function to read a line of string. And, you can use puts() to display the string.\n
To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), where  and  are the two integers.\n
The sum of numbers on two opposite faces of a dice is 7.\n

Who calls the main() function in C/C++ ??? ans is 'OS' . \n
 arr[3 / 2] = 2; // this is same as arr[1] = 2.\n
 No Index Out of bound Checking:
There is no index out of bound checking in C, for example the following program compiles fine but may produce unexpected output when run.\n
Also, In C, it is not compiler error to initialize an array with more elements than specified size./n
sizeof a pointer is printed which is same for all type of pointers which may be 4 and 8./n
   int *ptr = arr; //[HERE ARR IS DIRECTLY ASSIGN TO POINTER Assigns address of array to ptr ./n
Array members are accessed using pointer ->    printf("*(arr + 2) = %d\n", *(arr + 2)); .\n
int *p -> after defining we have to use pointer diretly by name like p = 10; if we want the value of p then only we have to use *p.\n
int fun(int ptr[]) {  //THIS IS CATCH ARRAY AS POINTER} .\n
int main{
  add(2,3)--> ACTUAL ARGUEMENT
  }
int add(int a,int b){} .\n
