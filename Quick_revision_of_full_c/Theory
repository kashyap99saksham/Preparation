An ‘int’ type variable in C language is able to store only numbers till 2147483647. Beyond this number ‘int’ fails to store precisely and even not correctly./n
The Below code is also correct but not a good practise. it is never a good idea to use “void main()” or just “main()” as it doesn’t confirm standards. It may be allowed by some compilers though.Difference between “int main()” and “int main(void)” in C/C++?
In C++, both fun() and fun(void) are same.
 in C, int main() can be called with any number of arguments, but int main(void) can only be called without any argument. 
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("Hello World");
}/n

In a C program, all lines that start with # are processed by preprocessor which is a special program invoked by the compiler. In a very basic term, preprocessor takes a C program and produces another C program without any #./n
Interesting Facts about Macros and Preprocessors in C
COMPLIER SE BHI PEHLE PREPROCESSOR KA PROGRAM RUN HOTA HAI. JO .C PROGRAM SE EK NEW .C PROGRAM BANANA HAI ,JISME SARE PREPROCESSOR COMANDS (ALWAYS STARTING WITH #) KO EXCECUTE KRDETA HAI ,
JESE IN .C PROGRAM WE WRITE #INCLUDE<STDIO.H> TO VO EK NEW PROGRAM BNA DEGA OR USME STDIO.H FILE INLCULDED HOGI AND ETC....
EG. OF PREPROCESSOR CMNDS 
#INDLUDE <STDIO.H>
#DEFINE PI 3.14   (HERE PI IS MACROS)
#UNDEF PI (REMOVE THE PRESENCE OF PI)
WE CAN ALSO USE LIKE #INCLUDE SUM(A,B) A+B
IN PROGRAM WE CAN USE SUM(2+3)--> IT GIVES 5    /n
There are some standard macros which can be used to print program file (__FILE__), Date of compilation (__DATE__), Time of compilation (__TIME__) and Line Number in C code (__LINE__)

When a constant value starts with 0, it is considered as octal number. Therefore the value of x is 3*8 + 2 = 26

int var_9 = 1; //VALID
int 9_var = 2; //INVALID
int _ = 3;   //VALID :)
In C language, a variable name can consists of letters, digits and underscore i.e. _ . But a variable name has to start with either letter or underscore. It can't start with a digit. So valid variables are var_9 and _ from the above question. Even two back to back underscore i.e. __ is also a valid variable name. Even _9 is a valid variable. But 9var and 9_ are invalid variables in C. This will be caught at the time of compilation itself. T

 When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized by the system, you must initialize it yourself. 
 Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows −

Data Type	Initial Default Value
int	       0
char	      '\0'
float	     0
double	    0
pointer   	NULL
/n

In C, static and global variables are initialized by the compiler itself.
